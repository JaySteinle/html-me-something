                        <p>&nbsp &nbsp My first car was a tan 1972 Toyota Celica. I bought it when I was 16 years old. I still remember the VIN number. Is that <b>crazy</b> or <b>cool</b>? You decide.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp &nbsp In 1984 I bought a brand new Olds Cutlass Supreme. I really thought I was on top of the world. I was making more money than I knew what to do with. So a new car only seemed reasonable.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp &nbsp My current car is a 2014 Ford Focus SE Hatchback. I have always liked the look of the Focus. When I went looking for a car, this was the first one I drove, and as they say <em>'the rest is history'!</em></p>
